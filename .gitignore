#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.

#   install all needed dependencies.

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include poetry.lock in version control.

Hello, how can I help you today?
.net hello world code
GPT-4o Mini
To create a simple "Hello, World!" application in .NET, you can use C#. Below are the steps to create a console application that prints "Hello, World!" using .NET Core or the .NET SDK.
Prerequisites:


Install .NET SDK: Make sure you have the .NET SDK installed on your machine. You can download it from the official .NET website.


Steps to Create a Console Application:


Open Command Prompt / Terminal.

Create a New Project:
dotnet new console -n HelloWorld
This command creates a new directory called HelloWorld with a basic console application template.

Navigate to the Project Directory:
cd HelloWorld

Edit Program.cs File:
Open the Program.cs file in your favorite text editor or IDE (like Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, etc.). The default content should look like this:
using System;

namespace HelloWorld
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
        }
    }
}

Run Your Application:
In your terminal (still in the project directory), run the following command:
dotnet run

You should see output similar to this:


Hello, World!
Summary

You have created and run a simple "Hello, World!" application using .NET! This is an easy way to get started with C# and learn about creating applications in the .NET ecosystem.
